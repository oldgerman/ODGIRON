[*SparkFun Power Belivery Board - USB-C (Qwiic) (DEV-15801)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15801)

The Power Delivery Board uses the STUSB4500 power delivery controller which can be configured over I2C. This library talks to the controller to configure a USB Type-C power delivery adapter to switch the voltage from 5V up to 20V and 5A of current.
