### Description

The MPU-6050 is a popular six DoF accelerometer and gyroscope (gyro) that has all the info you need on how things are shakin' and spinnin' . With six axes of sensing and 16-bit measurements, you'll have everything you need to give your robot friend an inner ear.

This combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers is commonly referred to as an **I**nertial **M**easurement **U**nit or IMU. Not so long ago IMUs were the [size of a breadbox](http://mentalfloss.com/article/55835/how-big-breadbox) and cost upwards of **$50,000!** While you're not going to be using it to guide your mars rocket, the MPU-6050 is several orders of magnitude smaller and a bargain at a price three orders of magnitude less!  Now you can add telemetry to your [water rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_rocket) (with some waterproofing).

As with all Adafruit breakouts, we've done the work to make this handy temperature helper super easy to use. We've put it on a breakout board with the required support circuitry and connectors to make it easy to work with, and is now a trend we've added [SparkFun Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) compatible [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) JST SH connectors that allow you to get going without needing to solder. Just use a [STEMMA QT adapter cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4209), plug it into your favorite micro or Blinka supported SBC and you're ready to rock!
